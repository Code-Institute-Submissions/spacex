# SpaceX API Website - Second Milestone Project
**Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute**

## Introduction
This is a Website calling the SpaceX API. The Website Fetches the data provided by SpaceX and displays it on
across multiple different pages. This Website will show what I have learnt over the last couple of modules and
provide an insight into what I am able to do with API's and Javascript.

## UX
### Strategy
The main goal of my website is to provide any users with a clear and easy to use site which provides information
obained from the SpaceX API. I have have kept the Design Minimalistic to give a good user experience by displaying
the data in a uniform and ledgable layout.

### Scope
| User | User Stories |
| ------ | ------ |
| SpaceX Fans | As a SpaceX fan I want to be able to view as much Information about SpaceX as possible, Upcoming Launches, Previous Launches, Types oF Rockets etc. |
| People intrested in Space Flight | As someone intrested in Space Flight I want to be able to see any upcoming Launches and any data on those launches. Also any information on how to watch launches.  |
| Astronomers | As an Astronomer I want to be able to see Upcoming Launches and information on what is being launched, previous launches and also what has been launched and finally information on the Rockets used to launch the payloads. |

SpaceX fans are able to view a vast array of data in a clear and ledgable format. They can see any a great amount of 
data about upcoming launches, previous launches and the various rockets and dragons. (Vehicle attatched to the rocket)  


### Structure
The site is actually only two pages, the main data page (index.html) and also a contact page. The page will update according to which navigation link
is clicked giving the impression of a multipage site, I have provided an alert to the users to say using the back button may have undesired effects and 
to only use the navigation links.

## Features

I have used Bootstrap as the HTML and CSS Framework to help me develope a responsive mobile-first website. The Majority of the page is written in 
VanillaJS as I wanted to showcase what I can do with Javascript
